# # Regression Week 5: Feature Selection and LASSO (Interpretation)

# In this notebook, you will use LASSO to select features, building on a pre-implemented solver for LASSO (using GraphLab Create, though you can use other solvers). You will:
# * Run LASSO with different L1 penalties.
# * Choose best L1 penalty using a validation set.
# * Choose best L1 penalty using a validation set, with additional constraint on the size of subset.
# 
# In the second notebook, you will implement your own LASSO solver, using coordinate descent. 

# # Fire up Graphlab Create

# In[1]:

import graphlab


# # Load in house sales data
# 
# Dataset is from house sales in King County, the region where the city of Seattle, WA is located.

# In[2]:

sales = graphlab.SFrame('kc_house_data.gl/')


# # Create new features

# As in Week 2, we consider features that are some transformations of inputs.

# In[3]:

from math import log, sqrt
sales['sqft_living_sqrt'] = sales['sqft_living'].apply(sqrt)
sales['sqft_lot_sqrt'] = sales['sqft_lot'].apply(sqrt)
sales['bedrooms_square'] = sales['bedrooms']*sales['bedrooms']

# In the dataset, 'floors' was defined with type string, 
# so we'll convert them to float, before creating a new feature.
sales['floors'] = sales['floors'].astype(float) 
sales['floors_square'] = sales['floors']*sales['floors']


# * Squaring bedrooms will increase the separation between not many bedrooms (e.g. 1) and lots of bedrooms (e.g. 4) since 1^2 = 1 but 4^2 = 16. Consequently this variable will mostly affect houses with many bedrooms.
# * On the other hand, taking square root of sqft_living will decrease the separation between big house and small house. The owner may not be exactly twice as happy for getting a house that is twice as big.

# # Learn regression weights with L1 penalty

# Let us fit a model with all the features available, plus the features we just created above.

# In[4]:

all_features = ['bedrooms', 'bedrooms_square',
            'bathrooms',
            'sqft_living', 'sqft_living_sqrt',
            'sqft_lot', 'sqft_lot_sqrt',
            'floors', 'floors_square',
            'waterfront', 'view', 'condition', 'grade',
            'sqft_above',
            'sqft_basement',
            'yr_built', 'yr_renovated']


# Applying L1 penalty requires adding an extra parameter (`l1_penalty`) to the linear regression call in GraphLab Create. (Other tools may have separate implementations of LASSO.)  Note that it's important to set `l2_penalty=0` to ensure we don't introduce an additional L2 penalty.

# In[5]:

model_all = graphlab.linear_regression.create(sales, target='price', features=all_features,
                                              validation_set=None, 
                                              l2_penalty=0., l1_penalty=1e10)


# Find what features had non-zero weight.

# In[6]:

model_all.get('coefficients').print_rows(18, 4)


# Note that a majority of the weights have been set to zero. So by setting an L1 penalty that's large enough, we are performing a subset selection. 
# 
# ***QUIZ QUESTION***:
# According to this list of weights, which of the features have been chosen? 

# # Selecting an L1 penalty

# To find a good L1 penalty, we will explore multiple values using a validation set. Let us do three way split into train, validation, and test sets:
# * Split our sales data into 2 sets: training and test
# * Further split our training data into two sets: train, validation
# 
# Be *very* careful that you use seed = 1 to ensure you get the same answer!

# In[7]:

(training_and_validation, testing) = sales.random_split(.9,seed=1) # initial train/test split
(training, validation) = training_and_validation.random_split(0.5, seed=1) # split training into train and validate


# Next, we write a loop that does the following:
# * For `l1_penalty` in [10^1, 10^1.5, 10^2, 10^2.5, ..., 10^7] (to get this in Python, type `np.logspace(1, 7, num=13)`.)
#     * Fit a regression model with a given `l1_penalty` on TRAIN data. Specify `l1_penalty=l1_penalty` and `l2_penalty=0.` in the parameter list.
#     * Compute the RSS on VALIDATION data (here you will want to use `.predict()`) for that `l1_penalty`
# * Report which `l1_penalty` produced the lowest RSS on validation data.
# 
# When you call `linear_regression.create()` make sure you set `validation_set = None`.
# 
# Note: you can turn off the print out of `linear_regression.create()` with `verbose = False`

# In[8]:

import numpy as np

l1_penalty = np.logspace(1, 7, num=13)

for penalty in l1_penalty:
    model = graphlab.linear_regression.create(training, target='price', features=all_features, validation_set=None, 
                                              l2_penalty=0., l1_penalty=penalty, verbose=False)
    predictions = model.predict(validation)
    actual = validation['price']
    RSS = ((actual - predictions) ** 2).sum()
    print ("%f, %f" % (penalty, RSS))


# *** QUIZ QUESTION. *** What was the best value for the `l1_penalty`?

# ***QUIZ QUESTION***
# Also, using this value of L1 penalty, how many nonzero weights do you have?

# In[9]:

model = graphlab.linear_regression.create(training, target='price', features=all_features, validation_set=None, 
                                              l2_penalty=0., l1_penalty=10, verbose=False)

model.get('coefficients').print_rows(18, 4)


# # Limit the number of nonzero weights
# 
# What if we absolutely wanted to limit ourselves to, say, 7 features? This may be important if we want to derive "a rule of thumb" --- an interpretable model that has only a few features in them.

# In this section, you are going to implement a simple, two phase procedure to achive this goal:
# 1. Explore a large range of `l1_penalty` values to find a narrow region of `l1_penalty` values where models are likely to have the desired number of non-zero weights.
# 2. Further explore the narrow region you found to find a good value for `l1_penalty` that achieves the desired sparsity.  Here, we will again use a validation set to choose the best value for `l1_penalty`.

# In[10]:

max_nonzeros = 7


# ## Exploring the larger range of values to find a narrow range with the desired sparsity
# 
# Let's define a wide range of possible `l1_penalty_values`:

# In[11]:

l1_penalty_values = np.logspace(8, 10, num=20)


# Now, implement a loop that search through this space of possible `l1_penalty` values:
# 
# * For `l1_penalty` in `np.logspace(8, 10, num=20)`:
#     * Fit a regression model with a given `l1_penalty` on TRAIN data. Specify `l1_penalty=l1_penalty` and `l2_penalty=0.` in the parameter list. When you call `linear_regression.create()` make sure you set `validation_set = None`
#     * Extract the weights of the model and count the number of nonzeros. Save the number of nonzeros to a list.
#         * *Hint: `model['coefficients']['value']` gives you an SArray with the parameters you learned.  If you call the method `.nnz()` on it, you will find the number of non-zero parameters!* 

# In[12]:

for l1_penalty in l1_penalty_values:
    model = graphlab.linear_regression.create(training, target='price', features=all_features, validation_set=None, 
                                              l2_penalty=0., l1_penalty=l1_penalty, verbose=False)
    non_zeros = model['coefficients']['value'].nnz()
    print (l1_penalty, non_zeros)


# Out of this large range, we want to find the two ends of our desired narrow range of `l1_penalty`.  At one end, we will have `l1_penalty` values that have too few non-zeros, and at the other end, we will have an `l1_penalty` that has too many non-zeros.  
# 
# More formally, find:
# * The largest `l1_penalty` that has more non-zeros than `max_nonzeros` (if we pick a penalty smaller than this value, we will definitely have too many non-zero weights)
#     * Store this value in the variable `l1_penalty_min` (we will use it later)
# * The smallest `l1_penalty` that has fewer non-zeros than `max_nonzeros` (if we pick a penalty larger than this value, we will definitely have too few non-zero weights)
#     * Store this value in the variable `l1_penalty_max` (we will use it later)
# 
# 
# *Hint: there are many ways to do this, e.g.:*
# * Programmatically within the loop above
# * Creating a list with the number of non-zeros for each value of `l1_penalty` and inspecting it to find the appropriate boundaries.

# * For `l1_penalty` in `np.linspace(l1_penalty_min,l1_penalty_max,20)`:
#     * Fit a regression model with a given `l1_penalty` on TRAIN data. Specify `l1_penalty=l1_penalty` and `l2_penalty=0.` in the parameter list. When you call `linear_regression.create()` make sure you set `validation_set = None`
#     * Measure the RSS of the learned model on the VALIDATION set
# 
# Find the model that the lowest RSS on the VALIDATION set and has sparsity *equal* to `max_nonzeros`.
